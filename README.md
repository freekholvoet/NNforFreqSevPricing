# Neural networks for insurance pricing with frequency and severity data

This repository accompanies the paper: *Neural networks for insurance pricing with frequency and severity data: a benchmark study from data preprocessing to technical tariff*, written by Freek Holvoet, Katrien Antonio and Roel Henckaerts from the KU Leuven.

The paper is available on Arxiv via

The markdown file NNforFreqSevPricing.nb.html contains a demo on how the models in the paper are constructed. It shows the autoencoder's training, the input data's normalisation, the CANN model with GBM input and the interpretational tools. At the end, we construct a surrogate model.
