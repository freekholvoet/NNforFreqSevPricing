The code in this folder was used to produce the results discussed in our paper. 
The code has been cleaned for distribution, meaning some of the data links will need to be changed in order to reproduce our results. 

The data files can be found in this repository, only the fitted models for the Belgian data set are missing. These were not produced by us but were used from the paper:
